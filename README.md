This is a plugin for the [lite-xl](https://lite-xl.com) editor providing support for the  [Djot markup language](https://djot.net/). 

Heavy wip. If you install it today, don't be surprised if it's changed tomorrow.

## Instructions
Drop the `language-djot.lua` file into your plugins folder (usually something like `.config/lite-xl/plugins`) and reload the editor. Type 'Djot' into the command bar to see options.

## Roadmap
- HTML preview
- Live preview
- conversion (via pandoc)
